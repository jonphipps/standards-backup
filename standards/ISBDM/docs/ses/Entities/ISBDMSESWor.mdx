<div className="guid">

This is a suggested string encoding scheme for an authorized access point of a work that is related to the manifestation.

The encoding scheme is applicable to the value of a <InLink href="/relationships/1001">has work associated with manifestation</InLink> element or element sub-type.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The base access point of a work is a combination of a value of an authorized access point of a creator agent of the work and a value of a preferred title of the work.

The ISBDM string template is:

[authorized access point of a creator agent of the work] + ". " + [preferred title of the work]

</div>

<div className="guid">

For a work that is anonymous, apply the guidance for the language or country of origin of the name that is available in <OutLink href="https://www.ifla.org/g/cataloguing/anonymous-classics/">Anonymous classics</OutLink>, if it is considered to be useful for users of the metadata.

</div>

<div className="guid">

The base access point may be followed by a set of qualifiers enclosed in brackets "(...)" and separated by semicolons "; ".

Add qualifiers to the sequence to disambiguate the basic qualified access point.

Added qualifiers are conditional on specific characteristics of the work that are recorded as attribute elements, including representative expression attributes. They support a tertiary collocation and sort order of authorized access points.
