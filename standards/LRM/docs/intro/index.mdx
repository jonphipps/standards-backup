# Introduction to IFLA Library Reference Model

The IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM) is a high-level conceptual reference model developed by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA).

## Overview

The IFLA LRM consolidates and updates three previously separate IFLA conceptual models:

- **FRBR** (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)
- **FRAD** (Functional Requirements for Authority Data)  
- **FRSAD** (Functional Requirements for Subject Authority Data)

## Purpose and Goals

The consolidation was designed to:

- **Resolve inconsistencies** between the three separate models
- **Create a single, streamlined, and logically consistent model**
- **Support use in linked data environments**
- **Bring bibliographic data modeling up-to-date** with current conceptual modeling practices

## Development Process

The development involved a comprehensive review of every user task, entity, attribute, and relationship from the original models. Definitions were revised and the conceptual framework was remodeled as needed to create a unified approach to bibliographic data representation.

## Key Characteristics

- **High-level conceptual model**: Focuses on the essential entities and relationships in the bibliographic universe
- **Linked data ready**: Designed specifically for implementation in linked data environments
- **Backward compatible**: Maintains core concepts from FRBR while improving consistency
- **Comprehensive scope**: Covers bibliographic records, authority data, and subject authority data

## Technical Specifications

- **Total Elements**: 117
- **Namespace**: `http://iflastandards.info/ns/lrm/lrmer/`
- **Suggested Prefix**: `lrmer`
- **Publication Date**: August 2017

## Core Entities

The LRM model includes several core entity types that form the foundation of bibliographic description:

### Primary Entities
- **Work**: The intellectual or artistic content
- **Expression**: The realization of a work in a specific form
- **Manifestation**: The physical embodiment of an expression
- **Item**: A single exemplar of a manifestation

### Agent Entities
- **Agent**: Entities capable of actions (persons, corporate bodies, etc.)
- **Person**: Individual human beings
- **Collective Agent**: Organizations and groups

### Additional Entities
- **Nomen**: Names, terms, codes, and other signs
- **Place**: Locations and geographical areas
- **Time-span**: Periods and dates

## Implementation

The LRM provides a framework for:

- **Cataloging practices**: Guiding the creation of bibliographic records
- **System design**: Informing the structure of library management systems
- **Data exchange**: Supporting interoperability between different systems
- **Linked data publishing**: Enabling libraries to participate in the semantic web
