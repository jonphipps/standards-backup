- **`link-validation-organization.md`** - Link validation system organization

## Recent Updates (2025-06-15)

### Configuration Factory System
- **Created `standardSiteFactory.ts`** - Reduces site configuration from 125+ lines to ~43 lines (66% reduction)
- **Centralized configuration** - All sites use `siteConfigCore.ts` as source of truth for paths and environments
- **Environment-aware URLs** - Automatic URL generation for localhost, preview, and production
- **Standardized navigation** - All sites get consistent navigation with site-specific customizations

### Site Configuration Improvements
- **LRM site refactored** - Successfully migrated to use factory configuration
- **Portal configuration optimized** - Already well-structured, no changes needed
- **Vocabulary defaults centralized** - Leverages existing `VOCABULARY_DEFAULTS` infrastructure
- **Consistent navigation** - All sites get `standardsDropdown` and proper cross-site links

### Documentation Added
- **`new-site-setup.md`** - Complete guide for site administrators
- **`configuration-architecture.md`** - Technical documentation for developers
- **`quick-reference.md`** - Common commands and configuration snippets

### Previous Updates (2025-06-13)

#### Theme Configuration Consolidation
- Created `baseDocusaurusConfig` function for shared configuration
- Simplified footer implementation across all sites
- All sites now inherit common theme settings automatically

#### SASS Integration Fixed
- Fixed ElementReference component SASS compilation
- Added proper dependencies to theme package
- Updated tsup.config.ts for SASS support

#### New Language Checking Scripts
- Added multiple scripts for language tag validation
- Support for markdown and AI-friendly output formats
- Can check MDX files, vocabularies, and SKOS data

## Note Format

Each documentation file follows this structure:

1. **Quick Usage** - Simple instructions for common tasks
2. **Developer Guide** - Detailed technical information including:
   - Location and purpose of related code
   - How the feature works
   - Related files and configurations
   - Modification guidelines
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Contributing

When adding new features or modifying existing ones, please update or create corresponding documentation in this directory. This helps maintain institutional knowledge and makes onboarding easier.

### Adding New Sites

**Quick Start**: See `new-site-setup.md` for complete step-by-step instructions.

When adding new sites to the project:

1. **Add site to core configuration** in `packages/theme/src/config/siteConfigCore.ts`
2. **Create site directory** with required files (`docusaurus.config.ts`, `package.json`, etc.)
3. **Use the factory function** `createStandardSiteConfig()` for consistent configuration
4. **Add build scripts** to root `package.json`
5. **Test locally** before deployment

The factory system ensures:
- **Automatic tooling integration** - Link validation, navigation, deployment workflows
- **Consistent configuration** - All sites get same base features and navigation
- **Environment-aware URLs** - Proper URL generation across localhost, preview, production
- **Reduced maintenance** - 66% less configuration code per site

See `configuration-architecture.md` for technical details and `quick-reference.md` for common patterns.
